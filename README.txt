Description: 1)This proram will create Megaint Calculator which is used for addition,subtraction,division,multiplication and many other options.

              2)You can clear the current value of calculator by typing c and calculate the hailstone by h and factorial by typing f botton.
   
              3) If you want to quit the calculator type q.

Note:I have used M1,D1 algorithms for the implimentation of multiplication and division operation, both are working fine but they are taking some time generally when user type a big number.
